# Polymer-Template with Pug, Babel and SCSS

## Prerequesites
* Install yarn - https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started
* Install bower `npm i bower -g`


## Setup
Run `yarn` in the root directory to install all dependencies.


## Dev
Run `npm start` to build and watch all files and start a dev server.


## Installing further dependencies
As Polymer somehow uses bower for all dependencies and some are not correctly available on npm
the best way would be to install all polymer dependencies with `bower install`.

Use `yarn add` for all other dependencies available on npm.
